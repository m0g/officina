        The Artists’ Residency program is open to Berlin’s artist community through the open call we publish on our website and other platforms. Through the residency program we offer the selected artists the possibility to be with us on a daily basis for two months and to be an active part of our projects as individuals or as a community. The Officina residency is a space for creativity, experimentation and analogue production.
