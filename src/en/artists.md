Since 2019, we’ve been running an artist-in-residence program, using our studio space and darkroom to develop unique art projects. Each time for a period of approximately 2-3 months, we invite artists of all types to join us. Their final exhibition at Officina Kreuzberg is not only the result of their own research and experimentation, but also of a collaboration with our members who supports the resident artists throughout their creative process.

_Wanna join us for the next residency? Please download the application form and send it back to [residency.officina@gmail.com](mailto:residency.officina@gmail.com)_

FOR THIS SUMMER RESIDENCY, ONLY APPLICATIONS FROM ARTISTS IN EXILE WILL BE ACCEPTED
