Since 2019, we’ve been running an artist-in-residence program, using our studio space and darkroom to develop unique art projects. Each time for a period of approximately 2 months, we invite artists of all types to join us. Their final exhibition at Officina Neukölln is not only the result of their own research and experimentation, but also of a collaboration with our members who supports the resident artists throughout their creative process.

*Wanna join us for the next residency starting in June 2021?  Please send an email to residency.officina@gmail.com before May 15, 2021 with a description of the project you wish to develop during the residency and your portfolio or link to your website.*
