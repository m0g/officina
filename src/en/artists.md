We are inviting artists to join our officina community for 2 months starting in mid June! You will receive free use of our workspace and creative support from our members. All types of artists are welcome to apply, although we are particularly interested in artists working with analogue printing techniques who wish to aid us in developing our small print studio.

Please send an email residency.officina@gmail.com with a description of the project you would like to develop during the residency and a mini portfolio or link to your website with previous work.
