content: Since 2019, we’ve been running an artist-in-residence program, using
  our studio space and darkroom to develop unique art projects. Each time for a
  period of approximately 2 months, we invite artists of all types to join us.
  Their final exhibition at Officina Neukölln is not only the result of their
  own research and experimentation, but also of a collaboration with our members
  who supports the resident artists throughout their creative process.

We are inviting artists to join our Officina community for 2 months starting in November/December! You will receive free use of our workspace and creative support from our members. All types of artists are welcome to apply. You will be invited to give us a workshop and we will organize an event to exhibit the final results of your residency (respecting COVID regulations).

Please send an email to residency.officina@gmail.com before November 1 with a description of the project you would like to develop during the residency and a mini portfolio or link to your website with previous work.
