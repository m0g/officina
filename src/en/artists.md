Through the residency program we offer the selected artists the possibility to be with us on a daily basis for two months and to be an active part of our projects as individuals or as a community. The Officina residency is a space for creativity, experimentation and analogue production. Our darkroom has been the catalyst of the programme and enabled another form of exchange to take place at Officina: between analogue and digital production, between traditional craft and contemporary practice. All the artists involved have used the space for experimental work, using the space in unexpected ways.
