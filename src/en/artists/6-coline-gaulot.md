Coline Gaulot is a French artist whose cross-disciplinary practice mixes painting, writing and installation. She creates colorful and narrative series around common themes and patterns such as the bouquet, the fireworks, the swimming pool, the birthday. Her work is based on the notion of KAIROS, according to which time is marked not chronologically but thanks to decisive moments that create a sea change. Events that happen in life, intimate or not, visual impressions, key moments. She brings us into her universe which is both personal and universal. 
**Residency project:** Pati-o-Shimasu - Coline explored the theme of “partying”, and in particular the absence of partying in Berlin, because of Covid. She focused on the feeling of lack of contact and on empty spaces by proposing a “party without people”. Sensory reminiscences expressed through a porcelain feast displayed like archaeological pieces, vibrant paintings of disco lights, a poem and light installation in the empty streets of Kreuzberg-Neukölln during the winter lockdown, and a video of the silent and deserted club Wilde Renate. Her work will be exhibited at Officina Neukölln at the end of May 2021.
