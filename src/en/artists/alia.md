“How Not To” - This project misuses photographic paper and processes to explore some senses of a “not”:not doing, not printing, not making, and end up with a collection of traces that speak of failures and absences. It is a way to approach not only of the literal but also the metaphorical and poetic sensitivity of the photographic paper, its openness to light, its response to exposure as darkness, the play of transparency and opaqueness on its surface, and the ambiguous, unreadable images that result. For traditional photographic purposes, the paper is rendered unusable, and yet something emerges that would be inaccessible when it is used correctly.\
Alia Zapparova is an artist and writer. She makes books, installations and occasional performative workshops from images, text, paper and thread in various configurations. Her work is a search for strategies and poetics of transformation through the everyday.\
During her residency at Officina she used the chemigram process, where images are formed as result of a reaction between photographic paper, chemicals and light.
