Born in 1986, Julia Castel studied graphic design at IPESAA in Montpellier, France. She obtained her diploma in 2007 and then moved to Paris where she worked as a Art Director.\
She quickly abandoned this advertising aesthetic in favour of silver photography, to which she was initiated by her parents. She trained at the Saint-Cyprien photography school in Toulouse.\
In 2019, she moved to Berlin where she developed her skills in fine Art photography and cyanotype. The same year she wins the first prize of "before & after" contest organised by Fisheye magazin

**Residency project:** La Grande Motte is a French city in front of the Mediterranean Sea characterized by a unique architectural context. Many of the prominent buildings are built in narrow contact with the sea coast and are designed in pyramidal forms - a failed architectural dream of modernist times.\
With 2 million tourists per year it is one of the favorite resorts in France. The buildings are not visible in the pictures, but their presence can be easily detected. This series is about unsucess, a city dream that 30 years has been futuristic, which now seems to be frozen in the past.\
During the residency at Officina Kreuzberg, Julia Castel used the cyanotype process to develop her pictures of the everyday routine in La Grande Motte. This technique allows the experimentation of mixing analog & digital development and offer a strong visual support to the ‘blue’ atmosphere of La Grande Motte.
