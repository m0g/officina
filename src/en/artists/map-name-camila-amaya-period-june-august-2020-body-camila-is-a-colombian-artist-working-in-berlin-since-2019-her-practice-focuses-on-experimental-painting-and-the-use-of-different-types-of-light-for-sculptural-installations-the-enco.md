Camila is a Colombian artist working in Berlin since 2019. Her practice focuses on experimental painting, and the use of different types of light for sculptural installations. The encounter of materials in her work reflect upon the multiple realities of modern digital society.

Her project in officina: Modern matter - A clash of opposing essences

Modern digitalized society exists within two contrasting realities. Cold, tangible, earthly materials shape our cities and dictate our interactions through space while an alluring, evasive digital reality encloses the sensory experience attached to our social interactions. During her residence at Officina, Camila worked with Dagsbirta (neural artist) and Marked by Necessity (producer) to create a sculptural audiovisual installation that explored the relationship between the spatial understanding of both realities. An experimental clash of substances and mediums in her work reflect on how an unlikely coexistence has formed between the opposing essences of material world and digital technology.
