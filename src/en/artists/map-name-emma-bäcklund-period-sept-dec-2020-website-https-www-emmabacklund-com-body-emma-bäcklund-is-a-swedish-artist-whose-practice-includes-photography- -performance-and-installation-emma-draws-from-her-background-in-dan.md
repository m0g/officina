Emma Bäcklund is a Swedish artist whose practice includes photography,  performance and installation. Emma draws from her background in dance and interest in neuroscience to make work that is deeply influenced by both cognitive and physical experiences. habitual and gestural relations.

**Residency project:** Emma’s practice is increasingly exploring the concept of collaboration and the workshop as an artform. During her residency she worked together with a group of children age 5-12 exploring embodiment of self identity within collectivity. With focus on finding new means of the concept togetherness, simple somatic exercises aim to function as catalysts to freely explore collective and individual expression. The cues vary throughout the duration of the workshop and investigate intimacy, mimicry, belongingness and the performativity of togetherness through improvisation dance, release techniques, drawing and photography. All participants are important and their influences and ideas affect the development of the workshop.
