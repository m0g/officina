Officina Neukölln is run as a collective by a group of people working mainly in the visual arts with a focus on photography and filmmaking, as well as researchers, translators, writers, graphic designers or music producers. Sharing more than a space is essential to us. We want to get together for a good meal, to create synergies as well as moments! Each of us is involved in the organization of the space and public events. It’s a place for interaction and sharing, where the skills and personalities of each contribute to make the Officina a unique and creative place.
