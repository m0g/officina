title: A creative community
content: >-
  Officina Neukölln is run as a collective by a group of people working mainly
  in the visual arts with a focus on photography and filmmaking, as well as
  researchers, translators, writers, graphic designers or music producers.
  Sharing more than a space is essential to us. We want to get together for a
  good meal, to create synergies as well as moments! Each of us is involved in
  the organization of the space and public events. It’s a place for interaction
  and sharing, where the skills and personality of each contribute to make the
  Officina a unique and creative place.

  community.
