Alina works in a humanitarian organization, developing and supporting projects with refugees and smaller migrant organizations in Germany. She is also doing a Master in Peace and Conflict Studies, writing a thesis that focuses on the artistic practices of migrants in Berlin, specifically of those who came to the city in the course of the revolutions in Arab countries in the last years. She conducts research on affectivity and translocal solidarity. Her goal is to connect activism, academia and artistic practices. In parallel, she also does analogue photography.
