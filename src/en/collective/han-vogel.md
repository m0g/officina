Han is a freelance art historian, curator, artist, picture editor and educator. Han's curatorial, artistic and theoretical approach is an extension of the self, whereby their way of thinking is always characterised by the collective, by Han's experiences and by the experiences of others. Han's approach is political in the sense that it deals with queer visibilities, identities, bodies, multiperspectivity, hierarchies and power structures.
