Julia was Officinaâ€™s first resident artist and is still part of the team. Although she is initially a multi-disciplinary designer (visual identities, spaces, websites and all kinds of printed matter), she loves to explore photography & illustration. She moved to Berlin in 2019 and joined our artist-in-residence program to develop her skills in fine art photography and cyanotype. She regularly conducts workshops in our space.
