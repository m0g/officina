Hi ! Iâ€™m Julia, a multidisciplinary designer based in Berlin. I design visual identities, spaces, websites

and all kinds of printed matter. Today, I work on a freelance basis with advertising agencies, private

individuals as well as with institutions.

I also love to experiment with photography and illustration.
