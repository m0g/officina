Laura is a data scientist and researcher. Her work has involved developing techniques to determine a persons susceptibility to developing stroke, presence of sickle cell disease in small volumes of blood, and novel fabrication techniques of micro needles for continuous glucose monitoring. Currently she is developing her machine learning and data science skills and using them to optimise carbon nanotube production. She is interested in projects that focus on healthcare or positive environmental outcomes.
