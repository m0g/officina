Lore is an architect and illustrator from Leuven, Belgium. She studied architecture both in her home town and in France, before moving to Brussels for urbanism studies and for the start of her architectural career. The focus in her work has been on spatial quality, ecological materials and narratives in projects. Since 2015 sheâ€™s been living in Berlin, a city that fascinates her because of its density of history, experiences and scenarios. Besides her job as an architect, she has focused these past few years on her art skills and on the human scale in and around the architecture field.
