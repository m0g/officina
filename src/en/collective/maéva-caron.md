After several years spent in Paris exploring the many facets of the photo and video industry (photo and event producer for a fashion magazine, photographer's agent, production coordinator and music video producer for a production company...), Maéva moved to Berlin in 2015 to work as a freelancer. Through producing and writing, she now supports creative personalities and brings their artistic projects to life. She also takes time to explore her own passions, such as analogue photography.
