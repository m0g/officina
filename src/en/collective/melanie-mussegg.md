Half Swiss, half Austrian and raised in Vienna, Melanie Mussegg was early on inspired by her father’s drawings, paintings and animated movies. Based in Berlin since 2012, Melanie specializes in character design, 2D animation and stop-trick films – preferably analog and handmade, and with a penchant for little things and big feelings. She has also been working as a graphic designer since 2007, with a focus on book design, while pursuing her twin passions in silkscreening and photography.
