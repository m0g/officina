Since we moved to our new space in Kreuzberg, we still have some free desks available which you can rent.

Our space is located in Kreuzberg, close to Hermannplatz. You’ll find everything you need close by: food, supermarkets and the Hasenheide is also across the streets.
We have a big kitchen and  a communal area and a nice terrace. We often sit together here and have lunch or an afterwork drink.
There is also  high-speed internet,  a printer and a  growing collection of creative tools and books which are free to use.
Officina is a space of exchange and community. Created by a group of people working mainly in the creative and political fields, we want to build a space where we pursue our personal activities as much as we organize our collective life and events open to the public (such as artist residencies, workshops, exhibitions and screenings). We are open to new ideas and welcome everyone who wants to take part in our communal events, which are a big part of Officina.
