We are inviting artists to join our Officina community for 2 months starting in November/December! You will receive free use of our workspace and creative support from our members. All types of artists are welcome to apply. You will be invited to give us a workshop and we will organize an event to exhibit the final results of your residency (respecting COVID regulations).

Please send an email to residency.officina@gmail.com before November 1 with a description of the project you would like to develop during the residency and a mini portfolio or link to your website with previous work.
