Officina pulls up their shutters and opens the windows to a space where two parallel lines come together: Inside and Outside, Stillness and Motion. We want to embrace the in-between and invite you to join us to a process of reflecting and cultivating.

This idea of an ongoing process guides our exhibition and our space in general. Officina members and their friends show yet unfinished and final works. A “still in progress” can be an invitation to sit still, to listen, to be in the here and now, to think about the (un)finished and make space for conversations and collaborations.

After spending several years at Grenzallee, Officina reopens its doors at Hermannplatz. Our new street-front space provides us with the opportunity to further engage with the public and connect with our neighborhood. Our setup is ongoing, and we are defining things gradually based on desires and opportunities.

Potential friendships and collaborations in the making. In-between drinks and treats, between neighbors and passersby we want to celebrate the finished unfinished.

More information on the program can be found on our website www.officina.berlin and instagram @officinakreuzberg.
