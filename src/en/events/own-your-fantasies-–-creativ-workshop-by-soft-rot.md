soft.rot invites you to the creative workshop “OWN YOUR FANTASIES”: We want to create space to explore, reflect on and creatively express your own more or less s3xy fantasies.

After a s3xual science input on fantasies, we would like to explore them together, reflect on them and exchange ideas. We will also look at our own sense of shame and the associated social narratives on shame and embarrassment. We want to make these visible together in order to process them creatively.

Afterwards, we invite you to express and share your personal imaginations and desires in the form of your creations.

This workshop is aimed at all FLINTA* who want to explore the potential of their s3xual fantasies.

We as soft.rot are a s3xual education collective that promotes s3xual self-determination through creative, political and holistic approaches to s3xual education and counseling while critically questioning shame, guilt and prejudice.

Participation costs 25/35/45 euros - depending on your budget. You can also always buy solidarity tickets anfragen❣️
