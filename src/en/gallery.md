title: Sharing a space
---
Officina is run as a collective by a group of more than ten people working mainly in the visual art with a focus on photography and movie making, as well as researchers, translators and writers. We share the tasks of maintaining and organising the space; we build, modify and repair as we go. What makes Officina unique is the focus on shared process, with a strong accent on the collective organisation of public and semi-public events.
