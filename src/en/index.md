exhibitions: Creativity is strongly promoted and inspired by exhibitions and
  workshops as moments of interaction and sharing. we share skills! During
  scheduled workshops members of the network and resident artists teach others
  their area of creative practice. During the exhibitions the distinction
  between creator and spectator is minimised as artists, producers and audience
  members work together or interact.
working_together: We don’t just work in the same room; we exchange. Eating
  together in the same space as we work has become an important practice for
  this. The community we form in this way is the same that activates to organize
  all the public program of Officina.
artist_residency: The Artists’ Residency program is open to Berlin’s artist
  community through the open call we publish on our website and other platforms.
  Through the residency program we offer the selected artists the possibility to
  be with us on a daily basis for two months and to be an active part of our
  projects as individuals or as a community. The Officina residency is a space
  for creativity, experimentation and analogue production.
