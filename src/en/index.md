exhibitions: Our collective is composed of diverse creative personalities
  ranging from visual arts to various forms of research or production. More than
  just sharing a workspace, we “live” together. Through encounters and
  interactions, little surprises and big sparks, we transform our ideas into
  common projects.
working_together: Through our residency program, we offer the selected artists
  the opportunity to join us for 2 months and use our studio space and darkroom
  to develop their artistic projects. We support them in their creative process
  and put all our heart and guts into showcasing their work.

  whose aim is to develop new ways of working and nurture the local community
  with an inclusive and social approach. At the intersection of the atelier, the
  home, the event space and the co-working, it’s a cross-disciplinary project
  space for experimentation, production, exchange, performance and exhibition
  that fosters multiple forms of creative practices and long-term artistic
  collaborations. "
