exhibitions: Our collective is composed of diverse creative personalities
  ranging from visual arts to various forms of research or production. More than
  just sharing a workspace, we “live” together. Through encounters and
  interactions, little surprises and big sparks, we transform our ideas into
  common projects.
working_together: Through our residency program, we offer the selected artists
  the opportunity to join us for 2 months and use our studio space and darkroom
  to develop their artistic projects. We support them in their creative process
  and put all our heart and guts into showcasing their work.

concerts_events: Our public events are an opportunity to cultivate community and
  create a network. Through exhibitions, screenings, performances, concerts or
  workshops, we explore various artistic expressions and give a stage to those
  we want to support.

events: public events are mainly an occasion for offering a stage to other
  artists to share their work (through exhibitions, screenings, performances or
  concerts) or to the members of officina to show their work-in-progress to a
  wider public.
description: "Officina Neukölln is a contemporary workspace run as a collective
  whose aim is to develop new ways of working and nurture the local community
  with an inclusive and social approach. It’s a cross-disciplinary project space
  for experimentation, production, exchange, performance and exhibition that
  fosters multiple forms of creative practices and long-term artistic
  collaborations. "
the_collective: Creativity is strongly promoted and inspired by exhibitions and
  workshops as moments of interaction and sharing. we share skills! During
  scheduled workshops members of the network and resident artists teach others
  their area of creative practice. During the exhibitions the distinction
  between creator and spectator is minimised as artists, producers and audience
  members work together or interact.
art_residency: We don’t just work in the same room; we exchange. Eating together
  in the same space as we work has become an important practice for this. The
  community we form in this way is the same that activates to organize all the
  public program of Officina.
